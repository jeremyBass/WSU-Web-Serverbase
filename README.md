#Quick overview
This is a project that is to make a local development environment that is simple to use.  In this case we are setting things up as `server` and `web app`(s).  You many load as many app and the server base when in local development will automatically be set up when you `vagrant up`.  The goal is to have to do as few commands as possible.
